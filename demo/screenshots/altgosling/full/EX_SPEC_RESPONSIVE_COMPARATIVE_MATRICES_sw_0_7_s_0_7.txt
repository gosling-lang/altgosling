Overlaid matrix and matrix. Multiple tracks are overlaid in this chart. Overlaid track 1. Matrix. The genome is shown on both the x- and y-axes. Both axes show intervals. The expression values are encoded using color intensity.    Overlaid track 2. Matrix. The genome is shown on both the x- and y-axes. Both axes show intervals.
