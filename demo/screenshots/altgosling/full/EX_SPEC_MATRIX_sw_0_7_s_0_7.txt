Overlaid matrix, matrix and chart with points with annotation. Multiple tracks are overlaid in this chart. Overlaid track 1. Matrix. The genome is shown on both the x- and y-axes. Both axes show intervals. The expression values are encoded using color intensity.    Overlaid track 2. Chart with vertical lines. The genome is shown on the x-axis.   The color of the lines is red.  Overlaid track 3. Chart with horizontal lines. The genome is shown on the y-axis.   The color of the lines is blue.  Overlaid track 4. Matrix. The genome is shown on both the x- and y-axes. Both axes show intervals. The expression values are encoded using color intensity. The undefined of the bars indicates the different categories.   Overlaid track 5. Chart with points. The genome is shown on both the x- and y-axes. Both axes show intervals. The height of the expression values is shown with the size-axis.  The color of the points is steelblue.
