Figure with 5 individual charts. Briefly, these are a chart with rectangles, chart with vertical lines and chart with text, 3 different unknown charts and a chart with connections.Chart with rectangles, chart with vertical lines and chart with text. Chart is titled 'NC_045512.2 Genes'. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.   The color of the rectangles is deep cerulean. The color of the lines is white. The color of the text is black. The x-axis has a brush, linking to one of the other charts. Unknown chart. Chart is titled 'S Protein Annotation'. The genome is shown on the x-axis.  The chart is stratified by rows for the categories.  Unknown chart. Chart is titled 'NC_045512.2 Genes'. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.    Unknown chart. Chart is titled 'NC_045512.2 Sequence'. The genome is shown on the x-axis.  The color of the undefined indicates the different categories.  Chart with connections. Chart is titled 'TRS-L-Dependent Recombination Events'. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.   The color of the connections is deep cerulean.
