Figure with 5 individual charts. Briefly, these are 3 different bar charts, a chart with triangles, chart with triangles, ideogram, ideogram, ideogram and chart with text and a chart with text, ideogram, chart with rectangles, chart with triangles and chart with triangles.Bar chart. Chart is titled 'Individual Marks'. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The color of the bars indicates the different categories.  Bar chart. Chart is titled 'Group Marks By Sample'. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis. The expression is shown on the y-axis with bars. The color of the bars indicates the different categories.  Bar chart. Chart is titled 'Group Marks By Genomic Position'. The genome is shown in intervals on the x-axis.
