# Contributing docs

We welcome contributions!

## Getting started

### PNPM
We use PNPM a package manager. To run the development server:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

The development server refreshes while editing code.

### Branches
We use the convention of `{github-username}/{descriptive-title}` for branches.

### Linting 
We use ESLint for linting. You can run the following: 
```sh
pnpm eslint
```

## Depending on a change in gosling.js
If your development relies on a change in gosling.js that has not been published yet, you can create your own packaged version of any branch by running the following on the desired branch in the gosling.js repo.
```sh
yarn
yarn build
yarn pack
```
You can then add this .tgz file with pnpm, or refer to it as follows:
`"gosling.js": "file:<relative path to file>"`

## Releasing a new version

GitHub Action handles bumping the version of AltGosling. The following commands will automatically increase the version number and release the new version in the NPM server.

```sh
pnpm version --patch # or --minor or --major
git push origin master --tags
```

## Structure

This project consists of three components

Gosling Component is created with a spec.
    GosRef refers to this GoslingComponent.
    The AltGoslingComponent subscribes to specResolved and rawData from GosRef

Whenever an event is published to specResolved, the AltGoslingComponent spec-map is created.
